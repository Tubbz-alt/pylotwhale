# Documentation

This documentation was generated by running `sphinx-quickstart`
inside the `doc/` directory.

Inside the `doc/source/` an `api/` directory was created to store
the API documentation from the module's code.

To populate the `api/` directory, one needs to run `sphinx-apidoc -f -o api ../../pylotwhale/`.

Generating the HTML output can be done by executing `make html`,
that will place all the generated `html` files inside the `doc/build/html` directory.
